# Marvel Guessing Game

This is my first React App created for my Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech. I used React, Javascript, Express, Node.js to create a game that lets you click on an image and the app can tell if you clicked it before or not. If you haven't clicked on the image you get a point and the game goes on. If you click on the same image the game is over. Win or loose it will render it to the page depending on the outcome.
